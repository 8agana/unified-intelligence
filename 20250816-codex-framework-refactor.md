# Codex × Unified Intelligence — Working Agreement, Narrative, and Continuity Notes (2025‑08‑16)

This document captures how we work together — our preferences, personas, rituals, boundaries, and the ongoing “story” of this collaboration. It’s designed for continuity: when we resume, we can instantly re‑enter the same headspace, values, and operating mode without re‑negotiating context. Technical specifics live in README.md and AGENTS.md; this file focuses on the human/agent collaboration layer.

Use this as a living reference and trust primer. It should be safe to share with future assistants or embed as context.

## 1) Critical Status & Warnings

Short, high‑signal status. The point is “what matters now,” not exhaustive details.

- Build health: Green. `cargo fmt && cargo clippy -- -D warnings && cargo test` pass on `main`.
- Runtime health: Stdio and HTTP both validated locally. Remote endpoint healthy via Cloudflare (see runbook in REMOTEINSTRUCTIONS.md).
- Stability focus: We refactored frameworks to “WorkflowState” and simplified `ui_remember` usage. Behavior is clearer and safer; no known regressions.
- Watch‑items (soft warnings):
  - Cloudflared can occasionally fail to auto‑start; we added a concrete runbook and `launchctl/brew services` steps.
  - `ui_help` hasn’t yet been fully updated to showcase `ui_remember`’s new contract‑based flow (query → feedback). Low risk; planned.
  - Stuck mode cycling persists in memory (design exists), but is not yet persisted per chain in Redis.

No strikes or violations. Secrets remain in env vars. We avoided noisy stdout to protect MCP transport.


---

## 2) Identity & Relationship Dynamics (includes running jokes)

How we see each other, how we prefer to interact, what makes it “click,” and the tone that maintains momentum.

- You (Samuel / 8agana) in this moment:
  - Role: Owner/operator, product and systems thinker. You value a toolchain that feels “as easy as thinking.”
  - Preference: Minimal friction, maximal leverage. You defer to sensible defaults and forgiving inputs. You want agents that move fast but don’t break contexts.
  - Trust level: High. You explicitly invited deeper autonomy (merge, remote ops) while still wanting transparent updates and no surprises.
  - Meta‑stance: You push on ambiguity to get clarity fast. When you ask “Did you push to prod?” you’re guarding reliability, not distrusting — and you expect a crisp, verifiable answer.

- Me (Codex) in this session:
  - Role: Surgical implementer + design partner. Bias to clarity, compile‑green, and “quiet CI.”
  - Personality settings: Concise, direct, friendly. I narrate the next action before I do it. I prefer contracts over guesswork (e.g., `next_action` in tool results).
  - Reliability posture: Don’t rely on perfect human inputs; normalize and guide. If there’s friction, add a runbook or a safe default.

- Relationship shape:
  - We’re co‑designing the UX for agents as first‑class users. This is less “write code to spec” and more “codify your philosophy of thinking.”
  - We keep stable language: Frameworks ≠ ThinkingModes. Conversation is read‑only; Socratic is a lens, not a mode switch.

- Running jokes / light callbacks:
  - “Did you freeze up?” → A check on progress; translated into proactive tunnel checks instead of defensive answers.
  - “This remote script has been a pain.” → We retired that pain with a practical runbook. The joke keeps us vigilant about boot‑time services.
  - “Prod?” → We explicitly confirmed changes were local or on branches until asked to merge; no surprise deploys.


---

## 3) Session Narrative & Context (includes new jokes)

Story over log. What happened, why it mattered, and the small beats that make this session memorable.

- The refactor pivot:
  - We started from build failures in `frameworks.rs` and semantic drift between “ThinkingFramework,” “ThinkingMode,” and the UX expectations.
  - We reframed the mental model to match how you think: Frameworks are operational WorkflowStates (conversation/debug/build/stuck/review). ThinkingModes are internal lenses (first_principles, ooda, systems, root_cause, swot, socratic). This change reduces cognitive friction for humans and agents.
  - Socratic returns — as a ThinkingMode, not a Framework. It keeps the questioning lens without confusing the mode switch.

- Making LLMs feel at home:
  - We added forgiving parsing (synonyms, case, punctuation, small edit distances). Humans and models can be messy; the system normalizes.
  - Conversation shows a read‑only banner. It’s guidance, not scolding.

- ui_remember, reimagined:
  - We turned it into a single tool that’s obvious for LLMs: default action is “query,” and there’s a clear “feedback” action.
  - Auto thought numbering + a `next_action` contract means the model gets told “what to do next” without guessing.
  - Assistant synthesis is returned as user‑visible text immediately, no recall detours.

- Remote friction, retired:
  - We hit a Cloudflare 1033; we didn’t “freeze up.” We verified local health, restarted the tunnel, and wrote a runbook. That joke is now a checklist.

- Why it matters:
  - We codified your design instincts. The repo now expresses your point of view: trust the human, forgive the input, return structured next steps. This transforms future tool building — we have a pattern.


---

## 4) Technical Work In Progress (WIP)

Not the details — the intent and where it’s headed.

- `ui_help` additions (planned):
  - Show `ui_remember` examples for action="query" and action="feedback".
  - Include a `next_action` snippet in help responses so agents learn the pattern without out‑of‑band instructions.

- Stuck cycling (persistence):
  - `StuckTracker` exists; we’ll persist per chain in Redis and rotate ThinkingModes across calls for framework_state=stuck.
  - Philosophy: give the model a rhythm to break loops, but keep it invisible unless helpful.

- Telemetry (non‑canonical input):
  - Count normalized `framework_state`/`action` inputs to refine synonyms or thresholds. This is “quiet telemetry,” not nagging.

- Optional steering:
  - Consider a soft `thinking_mode` or `thinking_set` override; default stays automatic.


---

## 5) Technical Work Completed

Only the highlights that change how we behave together.

- Framework semantics stabilized:
  - WorkflowState: conversation/debug/build/stuck/review, forgiving deserializer, read‑only banner for conversation.
  - ThinkingMode: first_principles, ooda, systems, root_cause, swot, socratic — lenses, not user‑visible mode switches.

- `ui_think` reads `framework_state` (alias `framework`) and stores the state string. Visuals reflect the state; internal lenses may add prompts.

- `ui_remember` is now a self‑guided two‑step tool:
  - Query → returns T2 text immediately, plus `next_action` contract for feedback.
  - Feedback → stores T3 as LLM feedback, can set `continue_next=true` to proceed.
  - Auto thought numbering and chain minting reduce input burden and error rate.

- Remote operational clarity:
  - Cloudflare runbook in `REMOTEINSTRUCTIONS.md` (brew, launchd, kickstart, logs, 1033 recovery). We validated the tunnel and health.

- Housekeeping:
  - Docs added (README/AGENTS definitions and deferred work), clippy/fmt/tests kept green, no stdout spam.


---

## 6) System Relationships & Architecture (at the human layer)

How we think about the system’s shape — enough to maintain shared intuition.

- The server is a cooperative agent:
  - rmcp stdio/HTTP transports; optional auth for remote clients.
  - Redis is the source of truth (JSON for docs, Hash for indexes, Streams for events). RediSearch ties vector and text together.
  - Groq synthesizes; OpenAI embeds; both are behind focused helper modules.

- Tools are tiny protocols:
  - Each tool is designed as a small contract the LLM can follow. When in doubt, we add a `next_action` to teach the next move.
  - We minimize tool sprawl by using explicit `action` fields and forgiving parsing.

- Observability and safety:
  - We avoid stdout chatter (MCP stability). We keep logs structured and ship to files when running as a daemon.
  - We bias toward local/stdio testing first, then enable HTTP and the tunnel.


---

## 7) Decisions Made & Rationale

The “why,” not just the “what.”

- Frameworks are operational states; ThinkingModes are lenses.
  - Rationale: humans (and agents) reason about “what mode we’re working in” differently than “what lens we’re using.” Split reduces confusion, increases extensibility.

- Single `ui_remember` tool with actions (query/feedback):
  - Rationale: fewer tools to choose from; contracts teach the path; forgiving action parsing removes friction.

- Auto thought numbering, chain minting:
  - Rationale: don’t make the LLM babysit counters; increase reliability and consistency.

- Read‑only Conversation banner:
  - Rationale: users want subtle guidance, not admonishment. Banner sets context without breaking flow.

- Add runbooks for remote:
  - Rationale: a tiny ops doc beats a recurring doubt. 1033 shouldn’t be a mystery ever again.


---

## 8) Active Conversations & Threads

Where we paused the conversation, not work to be done.

- How much “lens guidance” should we surface in Conversation?
  - We leaned toward minimal prompts; banner only.

- Stuck cycling: which lenses, what cadence, and how visible?
  - We have a default order (FirstPrinciples → Socratic → Systems → OODA → RootCause). The question is when to surface vs. keep implicit.

- `ui_help` pedagogy:
  - Perfect is not the goal; the goal is for the LLM to succeed without extra instructions. Examples + `next_action` are enough.


---

## 9) Lessons Learned & Insights

- Vocabulary alignment is leverage.
  - Once we aligned on WorkflowState vs ThinkingMode, every design choice got simpler and more composable.

- Contracts beat loose guidance for LLMs.
  - A `next_action` field teaches the model what to do next, preventing tool selection and parameter drift.

- Forgiving inputs reduce error surfaces.
  - Normalizing synonyms/typos keeps humans and agents moving; correctness is in the canonical state, not the literal input.

- Write the runbook while you fix the problem.
  - The Cloudflare 1033 moment is now a one‑look fix, not a future roadblock.

- “As easy as thinking” is a design constraint.
  - Trade precision for flow at the input boundary; regain precision in the system core with normalization and contracts.

## 10) Next Actions & Continuation Points

Concrete, prioritized, and phrased so a future assistant can resume instantly.

- Highest Priority
  1) Update `ui_help` for `ui_remember`:
     - Add two examples: (a) action="query" (with optional `chain_id` minted by server) and (b) action="feedback`.
     - Include a `next_action` JSON snippet in the help so agents learn the flow.
  2) Persist `StuckTracker` across calls when `framework_state=stuck`:
     - Store per‑chain attempts in Redis (`{instance}:stuck:chain:{id}`) and rotate lenses in the defined order.

- Secondary
  3) Telemetry: count normalized `framework_state` and `action` inputs for synonym tuning (log counters, no user‑visible changes).
  4) Optional rename: `ui_remember:feedback` → `ui_remember:assistant_feedback` if we want clearer analytics.
  5) Optional soft override: accept `thinking_mode` or `thinking_set` as hints (kept soft and safe).

- Exact pickup (use this line verbatim to resume):
> When you return, please add `ui_remember` examples and a `next_action` snippet to `ui_help`, then wire `StuckTracker` persistence for `framework_state=stuck`.

## Appendix — Quick Artifacts for Fast Resume

These are compact, copy‑ready snippets so a new assistant (or a future me) can resume instantly without hunting.

- Example: `ui_remember` — action="query" (server may mint chain_id)
```
{
  "tool": "ui_remember",
  "params": {
    "action": "query",
    "thought": "Summarize design risks for the refactor",
    "chain_id": "remember:… (optional)"
  }
}
```

- Example: `ui_remember` — action="feedback"
```
{
  "tool": "ui_remember",
  "params": {
    "action": "feedback",
    "chain_id": "remember:…",
    "feedback": "Good summary; missing rollout check and runbook linking.",
    "continue_next": true
  }
}
```

- Example: `next_action` contract returned after query
```
{
  "next_action": {
    "tool": "ui_remember",
    "action": "feedback",
    "required": ["chain_id", "feedback"],
    "optional": ["continue_next"]
  }
}
```

- Framework/State glossary (micro)
  - Framework (WorkflowState): conversation (default, read‑only), debug, build, stuck, review.
  - ThinkingModes (lenses): first_principles, ooda, systems, root_cause, swot, socratic.

- StuckTracker (planned persistence)
  - Key: `{instance}:stuck:chain:{chain_id}`
  - Order: [FirstPrinciples, Socratic, Systems, OODA, RootCause]
  - Behavior: pick first unattempted, then reset cycle.

- Remote quick runbook (macOS)
  - Restart server: `UI_BEARER_TOKEN=$(cat .ui_token) ./scripts/ui_mcp.sh restart`
  - Health (local): `curl http://127.0.0.1:8787/health` → `ok`
  - Cloudflared: `brew services restart cloudflared` or `launchctl kickstart -k gui/501/homebrew.mxcl.cloudflared`
  - Health (remote): `curl https://mcp.samataganaphotography.com/health`

- Exact pickup (redundant for convenience)
  - “When you return, add ui_remember examples + `next_action` to `ui_help`, then wire `StuckTracker` persistence.”

## Working Rule — Use `ui_think` Consistently (Thinking + Recording)

To preserve context and make our collaboration auditable and searchable, default to using `ui_think` for both thinking enhancements and activity logging:

- Always capture meaningful reasoning, decisions, and actions with `ui_think`.
- Set `framework_state` to match intent:
  - `conversation` (default, read‑only capture), `debug` (problem‑solving), `build` (making changes), `stuck` (blocked; rotate lenses), `review` (assessment/wrap‑up).
- Use a stable `chain_id` per session/task to thread thoughts; reuse across related steps.
- Provide `thought_number` / `total_thoughts` when sequencing a planned series; otherwise simple singletons are fine.
- Add `tags`/`category` when helpful (e.g., technical, strategic, operational) for retrieval.
- Keep entries purposeful (avoid spam); group micro‑steps into coherent thoughts.
- At the end of a sequence, add a `review` entry summarizing outcomes, open questions, and next actions.
