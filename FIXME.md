## Findings from Critical Code Review - 2025-07-27 (Gemini)

### General Observations:
- **Modularity:** The project is well-structured with clear separation of concerns (handlers, services, models, etc.).
- **Error Handling:** Uses `anyhow::Result` and custom `UnifiedIntelligenceError` for consistent error handling.
- **Asynchronous Operations:** Leverages `tokio` for asynchronous programming, which is good for I/O-bound tasks like API calls and database interactions.
- **Dependencies:** Uses `rmcp` for MCP communication, `reqwest` for HTTP requests, `qdrant-client` for Qdrant, `redis` for Redis, and `async-openai` for OpenAI embeddings.
- **Logging:** Uses `tracing` for structured logging, which is beneficial for debugging and monitoring.

### Specific Findings and Recommendations:

1.  **Frameworks (`src/frameworks.rs`):**
    *   **Issue:** The `valid_frameworks` string in `FrameworkError::invalid_framework` is a hardcoded list. This can lead to inconsistencies if new frameworks are added or existing ones are renamed in the `ThinkingFramework` enum.
    *   **Recommendation:** Dynamically generate the `valid_frameworks` string from the `ThinkingFramework` enum variants to ensure consistency.

2.  **Groq API Key Handling (`src/groq.rs`):**
    *   **Issue:** The `get_groq_api_key` function includes a hardcoded fallback API key. This is a security concern for production environments and makes deployment less flexible.
    *   **Recommendation:** Remove the hardcoded fallback API key. Enforce that `GROQ_API_KEY` must be set as an environment variable.

3.  **`QueryIntent` Structure (`src/models.rs`):**
    *   **Issue:** The `QueryIntent` struct still contains `temporal_filter` and `synthesis_style` fields, even though the `parse_search_query` method in `src/groq.rs` no longer extracts this information. This can cause confusion and indicates potential dead code or incomplete feature implementation.
    *   **Recommendation:** Re-evaluate the purpose of these fields. If they are not currently used or planned for immediate future use, they should be removed to simplify the data model. If they are part of a future feature, add clear comments explaining their intended use and when they will be populated.

4.  **Temporal Filtering in `parse_search_query` (`src/groq.rs` and `src/handlers/thoughts.rs`):**
    *   **Issue:** The `parse_search_query` method currently only extracts a simple search query string and does not provide temporal filtering capabilities, despite `qdrant_service.search_memories` having a `temporal_filter` argument.
    *   **Recommendation:** If temporal filtering is a desired feature, extend the `parse_search_query` method to extract `TemporalFilter` information (e.g., date ranges, relative timeframes) from the natural language query. This would involve updating the Groq prompt for `parse_search_query` and modifying its return type to include `TemporalFilter`.

5.  **Unused Warnings (General):**
    *   **Issue:** The `cargo check` output still shows several warnings related to unused imports, unused variables, and unused methods/structs. While these do not prevent compilation, they indicate code that is not being used, which can lead to confusion, increased build times, and potential for future bugs.
    *   **Recommendation:** Address these warnings for code cleanliness and maintainability. This can involve:
        *   Removing unused `use` statements.
        *   Prefixing intentionally unused variables with `_`.
        *   Removing unused functions or structs if they are truly dead code.
